Remote sensing has demonstrated significant potential for assessing urban damage in conflict settings across various regions. This study developed and evaluated a methodology for detecting structural damage in the conflict-affected region of Al-Geneina, Sudan, using open-source Sentinel-2 and cost-effective medium-resolution PlanetScope imagery. The approach employed Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture analysis, comparing homogeneity and dissimilarity metrics. PlanetScope's dissimilarity metric achieved notable accuracy, effectively identifying damaged structures despite the complex urban morphology of the area. Although Sentinel-2 models exhibited lower overall accuracy, they proved effective in detecting damage to larger buildings, underscoring their utility for broad damage assessments in conflict zones. The study underscores the potential of leveraging affordable and frequently updated satellite data for automated damage mapping, providing a practical alternative to more resource-intensive manual methods. This approach is particularly beneficial for humanitarian organisations requiring rapid assessments to inform interventions in regions with extensive destruction.
